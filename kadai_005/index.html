  <h2>Canada</h2>
<p>I have lived in Vancouver in Canada for 8 months.</p>
<p>During that time I have been to a lot of places.</p>
<p>I'm gonna show you the picures!</p>
<img src="images/First hiking of green lake in Van.jpg" alt="green lake pic">
<p>It is green lake in Vancouver.
  <br>I had never tried hiking so it was new experience for me.
  <br>I've felt big nature in here.

<img src="images/Sunset beach.JPG" alt="beach pic">
<p>It is a picture on the beach in Van.
  <br>We can't drink Alchol everywhere except in kinda restaurants, houses and beaches.
  <br>So I've enjoyed a lot of times on this beach.
</p>
<hr>
<p>Actually, I didn't like travel before I went Canada.
  <br>But I realized I love new things, like places, people, and cultures.
  <br>That's why I'll say my hobby is travel since then if someome ask.
